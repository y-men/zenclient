## Why Zengrid?

**How do you usually start planning?**

Typically, teams add epics and sprints to the backlog, 
prioritize them, and during sprint planning, 
the team pulls tasks into the sprint. 
Separately, quarterly planning is done using the same epics, 
but with a focus on headcount allocation, hoping to align 
sprints with this allocation.

The problem is these two processes often 
run in isolation, with no automated way to connect 
quarterly planning to sprint planning. 
The data is there, and it’s possible to bridge this gap, but it requires an enormous amount of manual effort. This constant monitoring doesn't provide a clear answer to fundamental questions like: 

*Are we on track with the epic? 
How much have we invested? What percentage is complete, and how much more needs to be done?*

Given that development is an evolving process—especially 
in research and development—this situation becomes even more complex. 
At the end of the day, we find ourselves in monthly, bi-weekly, or quarterly status meetings where we’re repeating assumptions instead of presenting solid numbers and facts. And as we know, assumptions are just waiting to be challenged.

This is how visibility becomes blurred, trust is lost, 
and projects end up delayed or even canceled.

**But what if we could approach this differently?** 

What if we could plan based on our quarterly 
goals and know in real time when deviations occur, 
allowing us to take action—whether 
it's accepting the deviation or changing focus?

How much work would be saved if the data worked 
_with_ 
us instead of creating more work? 
Imagine being alerted when deviations happen, 
receiving suggestions for solutions, 
and being presented with alternatives based on resources, costs, and timelines.

What if reports were automatic, 
real-time, and accurate—no guessing, 
just hard numbers? 
This wouldn't prevent projects from taking longer when new 
challenges arise, but it would allow us to identify these challenges in real time and act accordingly—or simply accept them as part of the process.

The difference is that now, 
everything would be **public, transparent**, and **collaborative**.
